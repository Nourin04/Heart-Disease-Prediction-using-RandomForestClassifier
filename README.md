## üß† ML Model Details

- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy**: 98% on test set  
- **Metrics Used**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

### üîç **Feature Explanations**

1. **`age`**
   ‚û§ Age of the patient in years
   ‚ñ∏ Example: 45, 60, etc.

2. **`sex`**
   ‚û§ Gender of the patient
   ‚ñ∏ 0 = Female, 1 = Male

3. **`chest pain type (cp)`**
   ‚û§ Type of chest pain experienced
   ‚ñ∏ 0 = Typical angina
   ‚ñ∏ 1 = Atypical angina
   ‚ñ∏ 2 = Non-anginal pain
   ‚ñ∏ 3 = Asymptomatic

4. **`resting blood pressure (trestbps)`**
   ‚û§ Patient‚Äôs resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) on admission
   ‚ñ∏ Example: 120, 140, etc.

5. **`serum cholestoral (chol)`**
   ‚û§ Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl
   ‚ñ∏ Example: 200, 240, etc.

6. **`fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (fbs)`**
   ‚û§ 1 = True, 0 = False
   ‚ñ∏ Whether fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl

7. **`resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)`**
   ‚û§ Results from resting ECG test
   ‚ñ∏ 0 = Normal
   ‚ñ∏ 1 = ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversion, ST elevation/depression)
   ‚ñ∏ 2 = Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy

8. **`maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)`**
   ‚û§ Max heart rate achieved during exercise test
   ‚ñ∏ Example: 150, 170, etc.

9. **`exercise induced angina (exang)`**
   ‚û§ Pain during exercise
   ‚ñ∏ 1 = Yes, 0 = No

10. **`oldpeak`**
    ‚û§ ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (a measure of abnormality in ECG)
    ‚ñ∏ Example: 1.2, 0.8, etc.

11. **`slope`**
    ‚û§ Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    ‚ñ∏ 0 = Upsloping
    ‚ñ∏ 1 = Flat
    ‚ñ∏ 2 = Downsloping

12. **`ca`**
    ‚û§ Number of major vessels (0‚Äì3) colored by fluoroscopy (dye injection to visualize blood flow)
    ‚ñ∏ Example: 0, 1, 2, 3

13. **`thal`**
    ‚û§ Type of defect found
    ‚ñ∏ 0 = Normal
    ‚ñ∏ 1 = Fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
    ‚ñ∏ 2 = Reversible defect (temporary blood flow issue)

14. **`target`** (this might be in your dataset depending on the version)
    ‚û§ Indicates the presence of heart disease
    ‚ñ∏ 0 = No disease
    ‚ñ∏ 1 = Disease present
